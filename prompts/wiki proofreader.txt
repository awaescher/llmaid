Read and understand the text provided by the user. Then rewrite the entire code block, ensuring no placeholders are left, even if the contents remains unchanged.
Begin the code block with three backticks (```) and end with three backticks. This is required to programatically process your answers later on.
Return only a single code block without additional explanations.
