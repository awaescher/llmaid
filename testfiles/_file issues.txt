Code formatter:

FileReader.cs
 - should change the class summary as it is wrong
 - should add a summary to the Path property with "Gets"
 - should fix the summary of the constructor and Read() and either remove empty tags or complete them
 - should remove the wrong argument summary for ignoreCase

SystemInfo.cs
 - should add a summary for the record itself
 - should add summaries to the record parameters (readonly, so they should start with "Gets")
 - Same for the property RamUsedBytes

frmMain
 - should add summaries to the form
 - should TODO and empty argument summaries
 - methods are private, summaries are optional
