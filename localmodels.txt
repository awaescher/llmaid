Pretty good for its small size. Comments were good, speed is great. But it failes in details like readonly properties. Also it modifies code from time to time.
Worst is that sometimes it describes the code instead of rewriting it and also it can format code blocks in an unexpected way which breaks the CodeBlockParser.
